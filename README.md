## SMiLe (SQLite extension collection)

SMiLe is a set of lightweight data analysis tools intended for SQLite. SMiLe tools can be compiled with SQLite source code, or loaded at runtime using SQLite's .load syntax. The tools are written in c, and often include Python scripts to provide example utilizations of the tools. In general, a full-featured data analysis toolset such as those provided by R and Python will be a preferrable option. For those cases where you just need a self-contained, portable system capable of self-analysis, you may find SMiLe to be suitable for your needs.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
